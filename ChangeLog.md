# Changelog for haskell-language-server

## 1.2.0

We have finally released a new version of Haskell Language Server!
Thanks for all contributors, many bugs has been fixed, and many features has landed.
Here are the summary of changes:

- Basic support for GHC 9.0.1 is added.  
  It does not support all plugins yet, but core GHCIDE features will work. For the detailed information that which plugins work, please refer [this list](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/297#issuecomment-855522891).
- Support for GHC 8.10.5 is added.  
  Note that macOS version is unfortunately not included in this release because of [a GHC issue with `network` package](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19968).
- HLS wrapper and GHCIDE session loader uses the same logic with implicit-hie.  
  This fixes [a build issue](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/1782) of a stack project with implicit `hie.yaml` .
- Wingman plugin has added numerous features and fixed many bugs:
  - It now supports tactic metaprogramming!  
    For list of commands, see [this document](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/blob/master/plugins/hls-tactics-plugin/COMMANDS.md#wingman-metaprogram-command-reference).

  - "Refine hole" and "Split all function arguments" code actions are publicly opened.
  - "Empty case split" code lens is added.
  - The name generator is fixed [to avoid dangerous summon rituals](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/1760).
  - Many bugs related to type families and GADTs are fixed.
- We support [nix flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes), an upcoming way to manage dependencies in nix.
- Every plugin (other than example plugins) now lives in its own package.

## 1.1.0

Haskell Language Server 1.1.0 has finally come! Many thanks to all contributors -- since the last release, we have merged over 100 PRs!
As always, there are many internal bug fixes and performance improvements in ghcide. Apart from that,

* Wingman gets many enhancements, thanks to @isovector for this epic work!
  * Wingman actions can now be bound to editor hotkeys
  * Experimental support for "jump to next unsolved hole"
  * Improved layout algorithm --- don't reflow instances, or break do-blocks
  * Wingman can now deal with GADTs, rank-n types and pattern synonyms
  * Wingman now respects user-written bindings on the left side of the equals sign
  * Significantly more-natural synthesized code when dealing with newtypes, infix operators, records and strings
  * Improved user experience --- less waiting, and friendly errors for when things go wrong
* hlint plugin not working in some cases gets fixed
* annoying log message "haskell-lsp:incoming message parse error" gets fixed in `lsp-1.2`
* eval plugin now supports `it` variable, like GHCi
* verbose message "No cradle found for ... Proceeding with implicit cradle" is GONE
* type lenses plugin now has its custom config `mode` (enum) [`always`] to control its working mode:
  * `always`: always displays type signature lenses of global bindings
  * `exported`: similar to `always`, but only displays for exported global bindings
  * `diagnostics`: follows diagnostic messages produced by GHC
* top-level LSP option `completionSnippetsOn` and `maxNumberOfProblems` are deprecated
* completions plugin now has its custom config:
  * `autoExtendOn` (boolean) [`true`]: whether to enable auto extending import lists
  * `snippetsOn` (boolean) [`true`]: wheter to enable completion snippets, taking the place of `completionSnippetsOn`
* Wingman has its custom config:
  * `timeout_duration` (integer) [`2`]: the timeout for Wingman actions, in seconds
  * `features` (string) [`""`]: feature set used by Wingman (See [the README of Wingman](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/tree/master/plugins/hls-tactics-plugin#readme))
  * `max_use_ctor_actions` (integer) [`5`]: maximum number of `Use constructor <x>` code actions that can appear
  * `hole_severity` (enum) [`none`]: the severity to use when showing hole diagnostics
* LSP symbols of typeclass and type families are more appropriate
* test suite of plugins are reorganized, which no longer need to be run with `test-server` executable
* two new packages `hls-test-utils` and `hls-stylish-haskell-plugin` are extracted

This version uses `lsp-1.2.0`, `hls-plugin-api-1.1.0`, and `ghcide-1.2.0.2`.

## 1.0.0

This is the celebratory release of Haskell Language Server 1.0.0!
This release includes a lot of internal changes, bug fixes, leaks plugged, and performance improvements, thanks to all our contributors.
Among others,
- We added the support for GHC 8.10.4, and removed the support for GHC 8.10.1
    Afterward, we will support upmost 3 patch versions for each minor version of GHC, if no special situation happens.
- As by hie-bios >= 0.7.3, we use (`${XDG_CACHE_HOME}`)[https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html]`/hie-bios/...` (or similar depends on OS) as a build directory for Cabal.
- Now Eval plugin uses the parsing mechanism of GHC and becomes more stable.
- We supports a code action to disambiguate the same identifiers from multiple imports.

- We supports a code action to hide shadowed identifiers from import.

- HIE DB is now integrated. This means we now support `find-references`, `workspace-symbol`. `find-definition` is also improved in a project with multiple components.
- Brittany and Stylish-haskell plugins now load language extensions from the ghc session.
- Tactic plugin supports eta-reduction and Agda-like split tactic and can create a function with piecewise definitions.

![gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12473268/103059293-af071f80-4572-11eb-963a-7e76b45f28b9.gif)

- The eval plugin has been revamped, adding these new features:
  - Tests in both plain comments and Haddock comments
  - For Haddock comments: shows differences between latest and previous result
  - Setup section, executed before every test
  - Execution of a section/group of tests at the time
  - Property testing
  - Setup of GHC extensions
- A new tactic to generate automatically `Arbitrary` instances has been added to tactic plugin
- There had been lot of internal changes:
  - ghcide lives now directly in this repository
  - the test suite has been cleaned and improved (continuing the work done in 0.7.0)


Thanks to all contributors and happy new year!

## 0.6.0

0.6.0 includes two brand new plugins!

- [Hlint Plugin](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/166): it integrates hlint diagnostics and lets you apply suggestions to fix them.

![hls-hlint-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54035/98731058-6ff38500-239d-11eb-8176-e4f69ef76fc2.gif)

- [Module Name Plugin](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/480): it makes easier create new modules and modify them, suggesting the appropiate module name as a code lens.

![module-name-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54035/98731198-a7623180-239d-11eb-8af0-73bd32b9b0b2.gif)

This release also includes many improvements and bug fixes for the tactic plugin (see pull requests authored by @isovector for more details).

We have updated two essential tools used by the ide:

- `implicit-hie`: [to fix a bug](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/498) present when loading cabal based projects with executables containing `other-modules`

- `ghcide`: the ide uses [the just released version 0.5](https://github.com/haskell/ghcide/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#050-2020-10-08) with many bug fixes and improvements, including:
  - code action to remove *all* redundant imports
  - improved support for Template Haskell
  - emit desugarer warnings

## 0.5.0

0.5.0 comes with a new tactics plugin which provides case splitting, homomorphic case splitting, and lambda introduction:

![Case splitting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/307223/92657198-3d4be400-f2a9-11ea-8ad3-f541c8eea891.gif)

It can even attempt to fully fill a hole!

![Attempt to fill in hole code action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/307223/94743611-82a18580-032c-11eb-9f13-8f46bc45f928.gif)

The imports lens plugin also learnt a new code action to make all imports explicit:

![Explicit imports code action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2488460/94994815-1a53dd80-0592-11eb-8a12-ec704ae92385.gif)

There's also plenty of bug fixes, improvements and updates to the underlying tools, including Fourmolu, implicit-hie-cradle and ghcide. [Some of the improvements from ghcide](https://github.com/haskell/ghcide/releases/tag/v0.4.0) include:

- The entire project is typechecked on load
- Reverse dependencies of a module are typechecked upon saving
- Code completion includes local terms
- Import code actions now also suggest open imports
- Documentation on hover shows for symbols defined in the same module

If you're eager to try all this out, haskell-language-server is now also installable via [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/):

```shell
$ ghcup install hls
```

## 0.4.0

0.4.0 introduces the import lens plugin, which can convert your import statements into qualified imports, or into an explicit import list:

![Imports code lens](https://imgur.com/pX9kvY4.gif)

The eval plugin has also learnt two new commands, `:type` and `:kind`:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-}
foo :: Show a => a -> String
foo = show

-- >>> :type foo @Int
-- foo @Int :: Int -> String

-- >>> :type +v foo @Int
-- foo @Int :: Show Int => Int -> String
```

```haskell
-- >>> type N = 1
-- >>> type M = 40
-- >>> :kind N + M + 1
-- N + M + 1 :: Nat

-- >>> type N = 1
-- >>> type M = 40
-- >>> :kind N + M + 1
-- N + M + 1 :: Nat
```

There is now also support for GHC 8.10.2, and a new `haskell-language-server --probe-tools` command to help debug what version of each tool HLS is using.

```shell
$ haskell-language-server --probe-tools
haskell-language-server version: 0.3.0.0 (GHC: 8.10.1) (PATH: /Users/luke/.cabal/store/ghc-8.10.1/hskll-lngg-srvr-0.3.0.0-7c6d48c3/bin/haskell-language-server)
Tool versions found on the $PATH
cabal:  3.2.0.0
stack:  2.3.3
ghc:    8.10.2
```

## 0.3.0

0.3.0 comes with two new plugins, retrie and fourmolu, provides binaries for
GHC 8.8.4, and comes with a host of bug fixes.

The retrie plugin supports RULES, functions and type synonyms which can be
accessed through contextual code actions.

Fourmolu can be used to format your code by setting the
`haskell.formattingProvider` field in your LSP configuration to

```json
{
  "haskell": {
    "formattingProvider": "fourmolu"
  }
}
```

The Brittany formatter is now also available on GHC 8.10.1.

## 0.2.2

This changes the configuration section from "languageServerHaskell" to "haskell"
to align it with vscode-haskell-1.0.0. Whilst the old section is still
supported for now, you should update your LSP configuration (which varies per
client) from

```json
{
  "languageServerHaskell": {
    "formattingProvider": "stylish-haskell"
  }
}
```

to

```json
{
  "haskell": {
    "formattingProvider": "stylish-haskell"
  }
}
```

([#248](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/248)) by @bubba

## 0.2.1

This release includes a new eval plugin that allows Haddock code examples to be
evaluated through a code lens. For example, the code below will now offer to
evaluate `intercalate " " example`, and will insert the output in the line
below.

```haskell
example :: [String]
example = ["This is an example", "of", "interactive", "evaluation"]

-- >>> intercalate " " example
-- "This is an example of interactive evaluation"
--
```

This is also the first release to have binaries distributed alongside it. Some
behind the scene changes include the GHC library directory now being obtained on
the fly, so either `ghc`, `cabal` or `stack` will need to be present on your
PATH depending on your project. See `docs/releases.md` for more information. If
you find any issues with this, please let us know!

## 0.1

### In this version

- cabal to 2020-05-02T10:11:15Z
- stack-8.8.3 to lts-15.10
- stack to nightly-2020-05-01

### Changes

This is the initial version, so too many to list individually.

The key point is that is now supports multi-component cradles, and has been in
daily use by the developers for some time.

It still does not have feature parity with `haskell-ide-engine`, but it is
currently useful.
