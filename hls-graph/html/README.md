# Shake HTML

HTML files used by Shake, primarily for profiling.

## Files

There are a number of HTML files which contain end user interfaces:

* `profile.html` is the actual profiler.
* `progress.html` is for viewing and debugging the progress reporting.

There are a number of JavaScript files:

* `profile-data.js`, `progress-data.js` and `metadata.js` are files with sample data, matching that generated by the compiler.
* `shake.js` is generated from the code in `ts`.

## Development

Before doing any work you need the jQuery, Flot and dgtable JavaScript dependencies. These can be found in the `js-jquery`, `js-flot` and `js-dgtable` repos. Copy the associated JavaScript files into a `lib` directory, renaming to take away version numbers and `.min` parts.

To build and test `shake.js` from `html` run:

    tsc -p ts               # generated shake.js
    tslint -p ts            # run the linter

Or, for the one liner:

    tsc -p ts && tslint -p ts

To test out the `profile.html` just open it after doing the above steps.
