# Example project used to run the experiments
# Can either be a Hackage package (name,version)
# or a local project (path) with a valid `hie.yaml` file
examples:
  # Medium-sized project without TH

# An ordered list of versions to analyze
versions:
# A version can be defined briefly:
# - <tag>
# - <branch>
# - <commit hash>

# Or in extended form, where all the fields are optional:
# - <name>:
#    git: <tag/branch/commithash>
#    include: true                   # whether to include in comparison graphs
#    parent: <tag/branch/commithash> # version to compare with in .diff graphs
