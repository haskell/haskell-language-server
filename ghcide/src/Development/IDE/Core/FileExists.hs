{- Note [File existence cache and LSP file watchers]
Some LSP servers provide the ability to register file watches with the client, which will then notify
us of file changes. Some clients can do this more efficiently than us, or generally it's a tricky
problem

Here we use this to maintain a quick lookup cache of file existence. How this works is:
- On startup, if the client supports it we ask it to watch some files (see below).
- When those files are created or deleted (we can also see change events, but we don't
care since we're only caching existence here) we get a notification from the client.
- The notification handler calls 'modifyFileExists' to update our cache.

This means that the cache will only ever work for the files we have set up a watcher for.
So we pick the set that we mostly care about and which are likely to change existence
most often: the source files of the project (as determined by the source extensions
we're configured to care about).

For all other files we fall back to the slow path.

There are a few failure modes to think about:

1. The client doesn't send us the notifications we asked for.

There's not much we can do in this case: the whole point is to rely on the client so
we don't do the checking ourselves. If the client lets us down, we will just be wrong.

2. Races between registering watchers, getting notifications, and file changes.

If a file changes status between us asking for notifications and the client actually
setting up the notifications, we might not get told about it. But this is a relatively
small race window around startup, so we just don't worry about it.

3. Using the fast path for files that we aren't watching.

In this case we will fall back to the slow path, but cache that result forever (since
it won't get invalidated by a client notification). To prevent this we guard the
fast path by a check that the path also matches our watching patterns.

{- Note [Which files should we watch?]
The watcher system gives us a lot of flexibility: we can set multiple watchers, and they can all watch on glob
patterns.

We used to have a quite precise system, where we would register a watcher for a single file path only (and always)
when we actually looked to see if it existed. The downside of this is that it sends a *lot* of notifications
to the client (thousands on a large project), and this could lock up some clients like emacs
(https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/2165).

Now we take the opposite approach: we register a single, quite general watcher that looks for all files
with a predefined set of extensions. The consequences are:
- The client will have to watch more files. This is usually not too bad, since the pattern is a single glob,
and the clients typically call out to an optimized implementation of file watching that understands globs.
- The client will send us a lot more notifications. This isn't too bad in practice, since although
we're watching a lot of files in principle, they don't get created or destroyed that often.
- We won't ever hit the fast lookup path for files which aren't in our watch pattern, since the only way
files get into our map is when the client sends us a notification about them because we're watching them.
This is fine so long as we're watching the files we check most often, i.e. source files.

{- Note [Invalidating file existence results]
We have two mechanisms for getting file existence information:
- The file existence cache
- The VFS lookup

Both of these affect the results of the 'GetFileExists' rule, so we need to make sure it
is invalidated properly when things change.

For the file existence cache, we manually flush the results of 'GetFileExists' when we
modify it (i.e. when a notification comes from the client). This is faster than using
'alwaysRerun' in the 'fileExistsFast', and we need it to be as fast as possible.

For the VFS lookup, however, we won't get prompted to flush the result, so instead
we use 'alwaysRerun'.
