{- Note [Code action resolve fallback to commands]
  To make supporting code action resolve easy for plugins, we want to let them
  provide one implementation that can be used both when clients support
  resolve, and when they don't.
  The way we do this is to have them always implement a resolve handler.
  Then, if the client doesn't support resolve, we instead install the resolve
  handler as a _command_ handler, passing the code action literal itself
  as the command argument. This allows the command handler to have
  the same interface as the resolve handler!
