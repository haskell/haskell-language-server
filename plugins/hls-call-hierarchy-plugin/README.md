# Call hierarchy plugin for the [Haskell Language Server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server#readme)

The call hierarchy plugin can review the code to determine where functions are called and how they relate to other functions.

This plugin is useful when debugging and refactoring code because it allows you to see how different parts of the code are related. And it is more conducive for users to quickly understand their macro architecture in the face of strange code.
