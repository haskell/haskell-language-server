# HLint Plugin for the [Haskell Language Server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server#readme)

## Configuration

This is typically done through an [HLint configuration file](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint#customizing-the-hints).
You can also change the behavior of HLint by adding a list of flags to `haskell.plugin.hlint.config.flags`
if your configuration is in a non-standard location or you want to change settings globally.
