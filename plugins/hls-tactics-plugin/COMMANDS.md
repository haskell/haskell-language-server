f :: a -> b

_ :: b
```

running  `application` will produce:

```haskell
f (_ :: a)
```

## apply

arguments: single reference.  
deterministic.

> Apply the given function from *local* scope.


### Example

Given:

```haskell
f :: a -> b

_ :: b
```

running  `apply f` will produce:

```haskell
f (_ :: a)
```

## assume

arguments: single reference.  
deterministic.

> Use the given term from the hypothesis, unifying it with the current goal


### Example

some_a_val :: a

_ :: a
```

running  `assume some_a_val` will produce:

```haskell
some_a_val
```

## assumption

arguments: none.  
non-deterministic.

> Use any term in the hypothesis that can unify with the current goal.


### Example

_ :: a -> c
```

```haskell
g . f
```

## binary

arguments: none.  
deterministic.

> Produce a hole for a two-parameter function, as well as holes for its arguments. The argument holes have the same type but are otherwise unconstrained, and will be solved before the function.


### Example

> In the example below, the variable `a` is free, and will unify to the resulting extract from any subsequent tactic.

Given:

```haskell
_ :: Int
```

running  `binary` will produce:

## intro

arguments: single binding.  
deterministic.

> Construct a lambda expression, binding an argument with the given name.


### Example

Given:

```haskell
_ :: a -> b -> c -> d
```

running  `intro aye` will produce:

```haskell
\aye -> (_ :: b -> c -> d)
```

## intros

arguments: varadic binding.  
deterministic.

> Construct a lambda expression, using the specific names if given, generating unique names otherwise. When no arguments are given, all of the function arguments will be bound; otherwise, this tactic will bind only enough to saturate the given names. Extra names are ignored.


### Example

Given:

```haskell
_ :: a -> b -> c -> d
```

running  `intros` will produce:

```haskell
\a b c -> (_ :: d)
```

### Example

```haskell
\x y z -> (_ :: d)
```

## nested

arguments: single reference.  
non-deterministic.

> Nest the given function (in module scope) with itself arbitrarily many times. NOTE: The resulting function is necessarily unsaturated, so you will likely need `with_arg` to use this tactic in a saturated context.


### Example

Given:

```haskell
_ :: [(Int, Either Bool a)] -> [(Int, Either Bool b)]
```

running  `nested fmap` will produce:

```haskell
fmap (fmap (fmap _))
```

## obvious

arguments: none.  
non-deterministic.

> Produce a nullary data constructor for the current goal.


### Example

Given:

```haskell
_ :: [a]
```

running  `obvious` will produce:

```haskell
[]
```

## pointwise

arguments: tactic.  
deterministic.

> Restrict the hypothesis in the holes of the given tactic to align up with the top-level bindings. This will ensure, eg, that the first hole can see only terms that came from the first position in any terms destructed from the top-level bindings.


### Example

> In the context of `f (a1, b1) (a2, b2) = _`. The resulting first hole can see only 'a1' and 'a2', and the second, only 'b1' and 'b2'.

Given:

```haskell
_ 
```

running  `pointwise (use mappend)` will produce:

```haskell
mappend _ _
```

## recursion

arguments: none.  
deterministic.

> Fill the current hole with a call to the defining function.


### Example

> In the context of `foo (a :: Int) (b :: b) = _`:

Given:

```haskell
_ 
```

running  `recursion` will produce:

```haskell
foo (_ :: Int) (_ :: b)
```

### Example

Given:

```

## split

Given:

```haskell
_ :: Either a b
```

running  `split` will produce:

```haskell
Right (_ :: b)
```

## try

arguments: tactic.  
non-deterministic.

> Simultaneously run and do not run a tactic. Subsequent tactics will bind on both states.


### Example

Given:

```haskell
f :: a -> b

_ :: b
```

running  `try (apply f)` will produce:

```haskell
-- BOTH of:

f (_ :: a)

-- and

_ :: b

```

## unary

arguments: none.  
deterministic.

> Produce a hole for a single-parameter function, as well as a hole for its argument. The argument holes are completely unconstrained, and will be solved before the function.


### Example

> In the example below, the variable `a` is free, and will unify to the resulting extract from any subsequent tactic.

Given:

```haskell
_ :: Int
```

running  `unary` will produce:

```haskell
(_2 :: a -> Int) (_1 :: a)
```

## use

arguments: single reference.  
deterministic.

> Apply the given function from *module* scope.


### Example

> `import Data.Char (isSpace)`

Given:

```haskell
_ :: Bool
```

running  `use isSpace` will produce:

```haskell
isSpace (_ :: Char)
```

## with_arg

arguments: none.  
deterministic.

> Fill the current goal with a function application. This can be useful when you'd like to fill in the argument before the function, or when you'd like to use a non-saturated function in a saturated context.


### Example

> Where `a` is a new unifiable type variable.

Given:

```haskell
_ :: r
```

running  `with_arg` will produce:

```haskell
(_2 :: a -> r) (_1 :: a)
```
