    • Couldn't match type ‘a’ with ‘[[Int]]’
      ‘a’ is a rigid type variable bound by
        the type signature for:
          test :: forall a. Ord a => a -> Int
        at src/Ide/Plugin/ChangeTypeSignature.hs:154:1-25
      Expected type: a -> Int
        Actual type: [[Int]] -> Int
    • In the expression: go . head . reverse
      In an equation for ‘test’:
          test
            = go . head . reverse
            where
                go = head . reverse
    • Relevant bindings include
        test :: a -> Int
          (bound at src/Ide/Plugin/ChangeTypeSignature.hs:155:1)
    |
155 | test = go . head . reverse
    |        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
