    • Couldn't match type ‘(a0 -> m0 b0) -> m0 (t0 b0)’ with ‘Int’
      Expected type: Int -> Int
        Actual type: t0 a0 -> (a0 -> m0 b0) -> m0 (t0 b0)
    • Probable cause: ‘forM’ is applied to too few arguments
      In the expression: forM
      In an equation for ‘test’: test = forM
      In an equation for ‘implicit’:
          implicit
            = return OpTEmpty
            where
                test :: Int -> Int
                test = forM
   |
82 |     test = forM
   |            ^^^^
