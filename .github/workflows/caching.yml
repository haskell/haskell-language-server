name: Caching

# Docs on the workflow:
# 1. GitHub cache scoping goes:
#   [main branch -> PR main branch -> PR. (essentially in a tree fashion)](https://web.archive.org/web/20211125171853/https://docs.github.com/en/actions/advanced-guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#restrictions-for-accessing-a-cache).
#   Building & keeping caches on `master` allows
#   to share the main project state cache be shared to the whole tree.
# 2. GitHub has a [default 10G cache pool limit](https://web.archive.org/web/20211125171853/https://docs.github.com/en/actions/advanced-guides/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#usage-limits-and-eviction-policy) per repo.
#   HLS is a big monorepo codebase, which means easy cache pool
#   invalidation & exhaustion because of the pool limit.
#   To keep caches useful - the main state of the main branch should remain
#   & so keep caching in the repo well below the limit.
#   that means preferring main branch to the PR caches
#   (especially internal branch ones), since PRs from internal branches -
#   count into the repo 10G pool, while that cache gets used only inside of the PR,
#   while exhausting the pool would bork cache for the rest of the community.
#   That is a short story why `dist-newstyle` (especially full) currently is not
#   includded into `master` or PR caches.

    # When cache is present it is a light check workflow with early termination.
    # When primary cache is not hit - runs the cache generation.
    # Why: GitHub repo has 10G pool & on overflow GitHub removes caches in FIFO manner.
    # When internal branche PRs save into the same pool -
    #   their cache is accessible only inside of the scope of the PR.
    # If main cache is forced out - there are no cache shared between PRs,
    #   which implies all PRs would start to create & save their cache.
    # Reinstitution of the main chache puts it back into FIFO
    #   & so it gets shared across all PRs.
